Now, the team consists of 25 women and 15 young men and women, some of whom work from home to manufacture products to be displayed and sold in the shop as a support for them.

With the simplest tools from our homes, we started to offer the most delicious local food made from the bounty of nature and cooked with love. We have been committed to supporting, empowering, and developing the capabilities of our team through programs that support and help local production to offer the best products with international features, free from preservatives.",

We participate in local activities that are done by the area's residents, such as olive picking and fruit harvesting from their farms.

We provide a safe space for visiting children and local residents where we offer non-curricular activities such as drawing, recycling, doll making, and strengthening lessons for students. We provide training in various fields to the local community to develop their life skills in collaboration with several local and international organizations and institutions.",
